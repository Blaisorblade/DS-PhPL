# Discussion Seminar: Philosophy of Programming Languages

## Organizers

Yi Dai, Lev Lamberov, Klaus Ostermann

## Overview

We have learned concepts and properties of programming languages.  Yet that is
_not_ the whole picture.  Programming languages, as an artifct for describing
information processing, are situated in a larger background that involves
humans, machines and other real-world objects.  When looking at this bigger
picture, a lot of interesting questions about them emerge: What is the nature
of their meaning?  How do they reach out to the world and reach in to our
mind?  How do they interact with their community?  What are esthetic and ethic
considerations about them?  These questions are beyond the reach of computer
science and require the attendance of philosophy.

This discussion seminar is a journey through philosophical investigations into
these questions raised about programming languages.  There may be no definite
answers to them.  But it is our wish that, through this journey, we will gain
not only a broader view of programming languages from a philosophical
perspective but also the ability to consider and evaluate programming
languages philosophically.

## Syllabus

### Meeting Times

To be announced

### Meeting Places

To be announced

### Prerequisites

It is _recommended_ that you take a course on programming languages (e.g.,
[Programming Languages and
Types](http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/ps/teaching/ws13/plt)) before
participating in this discussion seminar.

### Organization

This is a weekly _discussion seminar_ on _philosophy of programming
languages_.  In each week's meeting (except the first which will be a kickoff
introduction), one of you will present _an_ article announced in the previous
week and afterwards lead a discussion about it involving all attendants.  All
of you are required to read the article and submit a _summary_ of it _24 hours
before_ each week's meeting.  The one who volunteers to be the leader of that
week's meeting of course need also prepare for presentation and moderation.

# Discussion Seminar: Philosophy of Programming Languages

## Organizers

Lev Lamberov, Yi Dai, Klaus Ostermann

## Overview

The course is devoted to the philosophy of programming languages. The philosophy of programming languages is an integral part of the philosophy of computer science and is concerned with the philosophical questions that arise with the study of programming languages and principles of programming. The course is supposed to be an introduction to the main philosophical questions on the interpretation of computer programms and semantics of programming languages, their ontological committments, cognitive mechanisms of dealing with programming languages, and the beauty of computer programms. The philosophy of programming languages helps us to better understand the internals of both programming and human mind.

### Prerequisites

It is _recommended_ that you take a course on programming languages (e.g.,
[Programming Languages and
Types](http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/ps/teaching/ws13/plt)) before
participating in this discussion seminar.

### Organization

This is a weekly _discussion seminar_ on _philosophy of programming
languages_.  In each week's meeting (except the first which will be a kickoff
introduction), one of you will present _an_ article announced in the previous
week and afterwards lead a discussion about it involving all attendants.  All
of you are required to read the article and submit a _summary_ of it _one day
before_ each week's meeting.  The one who volunteers to be the leader of that
week's meeting of course need also prepare for presentation and moderation.

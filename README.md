### Prerequisites

It is _recommended_ that you take a course on programming languages before
participating in this discussion seminar.

### Organization

This is a weekly _discussion seminar_ on _philosophy of programming
languages_.  In each week's meeting (except the first which will be a kickoff
introduction), one of you will present _an_ article announced in the previous
week and afterwards lead a discussion about it involving all attendants.  All
of you are required to read the article and submit a _summary_ of it _one day
before_ each week's meeting.  The one who volunteers to be the leader of that
week's meeting of course need also prepare for presentation and moderation.
